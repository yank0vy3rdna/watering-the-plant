### Software

Software - arduino sketch, like blink, but delays are longer and delays had changed to custom func VeryBigDelay because some arduino's have bug about freezing in delays more than 20 sec.

Delay times are initialized at the begin of sketch and able to changing. This values are experimentally selected and are variable with different plants.
